Each review at minimum consists of review text and review star rating. Because of its size and richness, it presented an initial challenge for us to decide what data to include in our modeling and what features should be engineered. In addition, not every user has made several reviews or reviews with different ratings, so we needed to figure out what datasets to use for training vs. testing. To this end, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the data, specifically to look at relevant business attributes, user attributes, and reviews. We reasoned that these are the core information needed to link users and businesses with their preferences (hence, we disregarded data such as checkin, photos, and tip).",
